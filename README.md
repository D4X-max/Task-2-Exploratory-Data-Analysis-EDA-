# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-


I used the to_csv function to create the csv file for EDA purposes

The line of code for it-"filtered_df.to_csv('cleaned_titanic_data.csv', index=False)"

#STEP 1- Generating summary statistics
I reviewed the datasetâ€™s summary statistics to get an overview of each feature
I did this using a function called .describe and printed it out to see all the features and their values

#STEP 2- Creating histograms and boxplots

I created the histograms and boxplots using libraries like matplotlib and sns(seaborn)
I analyzed the data in them to find out any anomalies and relationships.

#STEP 3- Using pairplot/correlation matrix for feature relationships

I created pairplots and correlation matrix as shown below :

#STEP 4 and STEP 5 

I clearly explained all the relationships and commons understanding from statistical analysis on the graphs.
It is all written in the python notebook in the repository
